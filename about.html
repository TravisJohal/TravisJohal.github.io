  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I’m Travis! I'm currently studying Computing Science at Simon Fraser University. I’ve always been drawn to how technology shapes the world around us, and that curiosity is what led me into this field. What excites me most is the potential to create solutions that solve real problems and have a lasting impact.

Outside of school, I’m passionate about cars, basketball, and hockey. I enjoy learning how things work, whether it's under the hood of a car or inside a program. I’m always looking for opportunities to grow my skills, take on new challenges, and work on projects that matter.
